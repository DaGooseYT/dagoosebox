A Hi-Fi linear Class AB amplifier with Bluetooth v4.0 compatibility and enhanced/3D stereo playback. Watch the video guide about it here: https://youtu.be/7peg0jiGp7A

## Features
- Very low THD (~0.02% @8ohm)
- High output power (~25.7w x2 @4ohm)
- Low cost design
- Simple PCB layout
- PCB uses very common passive componants
